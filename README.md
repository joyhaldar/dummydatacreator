# dummydatacreator
I wrote this to make ETL testing at work easier. This script creates dummy staging data. This works for Oracle databases.

Dependencies:-
xlrd
sqlalchemy
cx_Oracle
pandas

Steps to setup:

Copy the script 'dummy4.py' to a folder and open cmd/powershell and execute the script and follow the subsequent steps.

I would welcome and appreciate suggestions and ideas.
